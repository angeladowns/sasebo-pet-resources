# Sasebo Pet Resources
February 2017

### A map of pet resources available in Sasebo, Japan.
It can be challenging to find groomers, pet supply shops, and even veterinary clinics in Japan due to the language barrier and the kawaii culture of using animal logos for businesses and services outside the pet industry. The map linked below uses GPS data to map known pet resources in Sasebo and includes data on the emergency hospital in Fukuoka. This hospital is the _only_ emergency facility on the island of Kyushu.
